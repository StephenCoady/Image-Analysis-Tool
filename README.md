Image-Analysis-Tool
===================

This program can be used to perform several image analysis processes on any image of your choosing. 
NOTE: it is still buggy. Images larger than ~4MB may not render correctly. 
You will also need to use the binary tab to binarise the image before being able to use the random colours process. 
This is due to the fact that the randomise function uses a binarised image to colour each component, 
and adjusting the slider is then reflected in the random colours image.
